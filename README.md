 I'm excited to share my latest project, where I delved into the world of HR analytics. Uncovering insights about attrition and retention.

The objective was to analyze employee attrition within the organization and uncover the underlying factors contributing to attrition rates. The dataset contains data of 1470 employees.

𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝: PowerBI, MS Excel
  
Data cleaning: To help us make data driven decisions based on data, Microsoft Excel was used to sort, filter, eliminate duplicate data, and do additional cleaning on the data.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:

1️ Young employees, particularly those within the age range of 25-34, exhibit a higher attrition rate, often due to their phase of career exploration.
2️ Total number of Employees and Attrition count: 1470 and 237, respectively.
3️ Attrition rate is notably higher among Employees with a Single Marital Status.
4️ Analyzed attrition rates across departments, job roles, age groups and marital status of employees.
5️ The Attrition rate was also studied based on Gender, along with their calculated average Age.
6️ Furthermore, I investigated the impact of job roles on monthly income, considering their Job Satisfaction ratings.

By presenting these insights, I help the company to improve the workplace environment and create strategies to retain valuable talent. Understanding the "𝒘𝒉𝒚" behind employee departures for building a more engaged, loyal, and successful team. 👨‍👦‍👦

This project not only demonstrates my ability to take on complex initiatives but also showcases my aptitude to making data-driven 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.
